# NAS2 | Not Awesome Survival 2
## Introduction
Welcome to NAS2! I am SpicyCombo, and this is the repo / plugin behind powering
 SpicyCombo's test survival server. The plugin is a continued, forked plugin of
 Goodlyay's [NAS plugin](https://github.com/goodlyay/nas/).
## How-tos
In order to use this plugin, you can simply just download a release from the
 releases tab. The recipes and [wikis](https://github.com/SpicyCombo/nas2/wiki) will be on the Wiki tab. It is pretty
 self-explanatory.
## Contributions
Contributions are appreciated. I will update everything I add by commit.
