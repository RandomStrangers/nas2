Welcome to NAS2! I am SpicyCombo, and this is the repo / plugin behind powering
 SpicyCombo's test survival server. The plugin is a continued, forked plugin of
 Goodlyay's [NAS plugin](https://github.com/goodlyay/nas/).
## How-tos
In order to use this plugin, you can simply download a release from the
 releases tab. The tips, items, and recipes will be on the [Wiki](https://github.com/spicycombo/nas2) tab. It is 
 pretty self-explanatory.
## License
